title: Scaling .onion sites
---

A while ago a question was asked on the
[tor-talk](https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-talk)
mailing list about "scaling a .onion site."

First off, it's pretty neat that enough people are using Tor [Hidden
Services](https://www.torproject.org/docs/hidden-services.html.en) such that
*scaling* a site running a Hidden Service is required. 

I figured I would write up a little guide on how to set up a "scalable hidden
service" to help those looking to build genuinely interesting services out
there.

## Step 1

Actually setting up a Hidden Service for the first time is likely the biggest
hurdle most people will face. Creating a useful Hidden Service is a much bigger
challenge than creating a scalable one. To accomplish this I highly recommend
**[this guide](https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-hidden-service.html.en)**
from the Tor project.


## Step 2
