title: Thanks RiseUp
---

I find myself appreciating the services that [RiseUp](https://www.riseup.net)
provides more and more as the days pass by.

Today I discovered that my existing email account also gives me a Jabber (also known as XMPP) account under the same account name. I also discovered two new *beta* services:

* [RiseUp VPN](https://help.riseup.net/vpn) - I wish I could summon the courage to use this service as I am sure it would be invaluable. Unfortunately I'm very cautious to never leak or connect to any of RiseUp's services except through [Tor](https://www.torproject.org). This is not due to a lack of trust of RiseUp, but a severe lack of trust of any bad actors between myself and RiseUp.
* [RiseUp Etherpad](https://pad.riseup.net/) (also accessible under [this .onion](https://ttbmov2dezfs2fln.onion/) link).

The men and women behind RiseUp are really doing a bang-up job, I only wish I could do more to support them in their quest.

Until BitCoin takes off, or some form of anonymous cash mailing becomes viable/securable, I'll have to continue to cheer from the sidelines.


Regardless, thank you RiseUp!
